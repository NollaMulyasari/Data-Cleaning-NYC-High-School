# Data-Cleaning-NYC-High-School

This project is Data Cleaning Guided Project from Dataquest
In this project we explored relationships between SAT scores and demographic factors in New York City public schools. For a brief bit of background, the SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year. The SAT has three sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.

New York City has published data on [student SAT scores by high school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4), along with additional demographic data sets. Over the last three missions, we combined the following data sets into a single, clean pandas dataframe:

[SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
[School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statist/7z8d-msnt) - Attendance information for each school in New York City
[Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3) - Information on class size for each school
[AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-AP-College-Board-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e) - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
[Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-School-Level/vh2h-md7a)
 - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
[Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-2012-School-Demographics-and-Accountability-S/ihfw-zy9j) - Demographic information for each school
[School survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8)
 - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school
New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test. For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.
